Buttebot is a bot which butts things (in Python). The e stands for "extra"!

Many thanks to the authors of the original Buttbot[1] and all the Cobolleros
who've stayed true to Butt(e)bot throughout the years.

"I'm actually a bit surprised someone decided to drop $50 to spam 'butts'
everywhere. Tarnishing an otherwise amazing experience."
